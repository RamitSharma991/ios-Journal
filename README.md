1. Swift Alorithms and Collection Packages.
- Map: Makes loops faster and clearer. It provides extra context that the body of the closure, regardless of its length or complexity, is just transforming the input. Using map also makes this code faster because it avoids intermediate allocations due to array resizing by reserving capacity which raw loops don't bother doing.
- Compact Map: A map and filter algorithm that collects and iterates data, filtering out nils and mapping to unwrap optionals
- FlatMap: it joins together all the inner arrays into a single, flat collection of elements. This pattern of mapping and joining is so common that we define another special kind of map for it: flatMap. 
- Chaining together Algorithms
